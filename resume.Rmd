Nick Strayer {#title}

```{r}
intro_text <- "Kristina Loen is looking to leverage her education and passion for science and communication to pivot out of the fintech industry. Most of her career has been in high-paced environments with strict regulatory needs while providing high service levels to financial institutions and external clients. As part of her current duties, she regularly communicates technical data to all levels of the business, including SVPs and above, as analysis of major technical incidents and regular reporting on the operations environment. She has always been passionate about science, and completed her four-year degree at ASU. With auto-acceptance into the MS of Program Evaluation and Data Analytics, she wants to continue honing her quantitative reasoning skills and marry those to her existing technical communication expertise. In her free time Kristina enjoys astrophotography, creative writing, learning languages, and has recently taken up knitting again.
